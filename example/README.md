Converting the file we're given by Apple...

```
openssl x509 -in merchant_id.cer -inform DER -out merchant_id.pem -outform PEM

# need our .key generated by ssl private key (+ password), we need .p12 from keychain to .key using the init password from keychain

certs cawfree$ openssl pkcs12 -in private.p12 -nodes -out private.key -nocerts

#Â convert original merchant id to p12
openssl pkcs12 -export -out merchant_id.p12 -inkey private.key -in merchant_id.pem

```
